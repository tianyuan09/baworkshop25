Welcome to the Business Analytics Workshop 2025! 

Building on prior exposure to programming and modeling fundamentals, this workshop focuses on real-world applications through cutting-edge tools like VS Code, Git, GitHub Copilot, and no-code/low-code AI agent platforms. Participants will engage with case-based exercises and live
demonstrations to explore how modern data-driven teams collaborate, code, and build AI-enhanced solutions in agile business environments. This workshop seeks to bridge analytical modeling, modern
software practices, and AI development workflows.
