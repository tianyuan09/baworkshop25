These Jupyter notebook environments make coding easy; however, this convenience often means skipping an important part of programming: working with real Python files (.py) and using the terminal to run and manage code.\nThis “missing piece” is essential for understanding how programming works in real projects, servers, and production systems.\nSo, before diving deeper into advanced business data workflows, we’ll start by filling this gap, and learn the command lines and terminal to navigate files, run Python scripts, and operate in professional computing environments.\nWhat You’ll Learn Next",

    "text": "1.2 Operating Systems Overview\nMost students in this course use Windows, which dominates personal computers with roughly 70–75% of the global desktop market. macOS holds about 15–20%, while Linux and others make up a small share of personal use.\nIn contrast, the enterprise, cloud, AI/ML, and high-performance computing (HPC) worlds are very different. Linux and other Unix-like systems are the backbone in web servers, cloud computing and supercomputers, making up nearly half of cloud workloads and being the OS for all top 500 supercomputers. Popular Unix and Linux systems include:\n\nUbuntu\nDebian\nFedora\nRed Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotemacOS is Unix-based\n\n\n\nAlthough macOS looks different, it is actually Unix-based, meaning the terminal commands and Bash shell you’ll learn in this course work much the same on both macOS and Linux.\n\n\n\nServers Linux holds a 62.7% market share for server operating systems.\n\nWeb servers: 77–88% of public web servers run on Linux or other Unix-like systems. It is the most used operating system for web servers globally.\n\nCloud computing Cloud workloads are heavily dependent on Linux-based operating systems. As of mid-2025, Linux powers 49.2% of all global cloud workloads.\nSupercomputers Linux has a complete monopoly in the supercomputing sector. 100% market share: Since 2017, 100% of the world’s top 500 supercomputers have run on Linux.\nAI and ML workloads Linux is the clear leader for AI and ML projects and infrastructure. In mid-2025, 87.8% of machine learning workloads ran on Linux infrastructure. Large ML and data science deployments predominantly run on Linux-based or Unix-based servers.\n\nCloud environments: Cloud providers like AWS, Google Cloud (GCP), Colab, and Microsoft Azure, which are leading providers for AI services, primarily offer Linux-based instances for running AI and ML tasks.\n\n\nSource: Wikipedia - Usage share of operating systems Azure Official Page, Microsoft Tech Community Update (Feb 2025)\n\n1.2.1 What Operating System does Google Colab use?\nLet’s take a look at what is the operating system (OS) that running Google Colab. You can type the following command lines in the Terminal.\n# Bash\n# Display info about the operating system\ncat /etc/*-release\n\n# Display the Linux kernel version and build info\ncat /proc/version\nSee image below for the outputs.",

    "text": "1.4 Why Learn Bash commands and Terminal?\nFirst, data science projects often run on servers or cloud environments, not personal laptops which lack the computational power for large-scale training, data processing, or deployment.\nThese servers — such as AWS EC2, Azure VMs, or Google Cloud Compute instances — usually run Linux or Unix systems and don’t include a graphical user interface (GUI) by default. — they are managed entirely through the command line interface (CLI). To interact with them efficiently, you use Bash, a powerful and widely used command-line shell.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipWhat is a GUI?\n\n\n\nA Graphical User Interface (UI) is the visual part of your computer — windows, buttons, and menus you click with the mouse. However, Linux servers don’t usually have this kind of visual interface.\nInstead, users interact with them through script commands typed into a terminal such as bash.\n\n\n\n1.4.1 GUI, CLI, Terminal and Desktop\n\n\nGUI (Graphical User Interface) – The visual interface you use with a mouse, icons, and windows, such as Windows desktop, macOS Finder. GUIs are user-friendly but less efficient for automation or remote access.\nCLI (Command Line Interface) – A text-based interface where you type commands instead of clicking.\nTerminal – The program that provides access to the CLI. It’s like a window that lets you type commands and see text output, such as Windows PowerShell, macOS Terminal, Linux bash Terminal.\nDesktop Environment – The collection of GUI components that make up the user’s graphical workspace — including the taskbar, file explorer, and app windows; such as Windows Desktop, macOS.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteSummary\n\n\n\n\nThe Terminal gives you access to the CLI, while the Desktop Environment provides a GUI.\n\nBoth let you control the same computer — one through text, the other through graphics.",

    "text": "2.6 Make a .py file as a module\n\n2.6.1 Python module review\n Python modules and packages generally fall into four categories: built-in, standard library, third-party, and user-defined (see in Figure 2.4). So far, you’ve worked with the first three — modules that come with Python (e.g., datetime) or are installed from external sources (e.g., pandas).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.4: Categories of Python Modules/Packages\n\n\n\n\n\n2.6.2 Create a user-defined Module in .py file\nIn this section, you’ll learn how to create your own .py module with reuseable functions – one that can be both imported into a Colab notebook and run independently for testing.\nCreate my_util.py in the scripts folder.\n# scripts/my_utils.py\n\ndef greet(name):\n    \"\"\"Return a personalized greeting.\"\"\"\n    return f\"Hello, {name}!\"\n\ndef add_numbers(a, b):\n    \"\"\"Return the sum of two numbers.\"\"\"\n    return a + b\n\n# many functions that you may want to re-use. \n\n# This block runs only if you execute `python my_utils.py`\n# This will make the .py file both run alone or import as a module\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(\"Running my_utils.py as a standalone script...\")\n    print(greet(\"Tester\"))\n    print(\"5 + 7 =\", add_numbers(5, 7))\nOption 1: Run as a standalone .py file\npython scripts/my_utils.py\n\nOption 2: Run as a user-defined modules with reusable functions\nCreate a test_util.ipynb file in the same folder as your my_utils.py file. Then, you can do import my_utils to use it like any module/package that you have used before.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteWhat does if __name__ == \"__main__\" do?\n\n\n\n__name__ is a special variable that Python automatically sets when a file is run or imported.\n\nIf the file is run directly (e.g., python my_utils.py), __name__ becomes \"__main__\".\nIf the file is imported (e.g., import my_utils), __name__ becomes the module’s name (\"my_utils\").\nif __name__ == \"__main__\" ensures that code inside it runs only when the file is executed directly, not when imported. This allows a .py file to act as both:\n\na reusable module (when imported)\na standalone script for testing or demos (when run directly).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteWhat if you remove the if __name__ == \"__main__\": line\n\n\n\nIf you do that, and then import the module, any code at the bottom of the file will run automatically during import, which can cause unwanted behavior (like printing, running tests, or altering data), see Figure 2.5.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.5: Removing __main__\n\n\n\nThe if __name__ == \"__main__\": line isn’t required for a module to work, but it helps keep your code tidy and organized, allowing the file to be used both as a reusable module and as a standalone script with testing.\nYou also can import a single or multiple functions in a .py file.\n# import the greet(), add_numbers() functions\nfrom my_utils import greet, add_numbers\n\nprint(greet(\"Bob\"))           # Output: Hello, Bob!\nprint(add_numbers(10, 5))     # Output: 10 + 5 = 15\n\n\n2.6.3 Download .ipynb file as a .py file",

    "text": "4.4 Reflections on AI in Development Workflows\n\n4.4.1 Vibe-coding vs AI-assisted Coding\nOn Day 1, if you used Agent Mode in Copilot to build your Streamlit app — without reading or understanding any of the code — you were vibe-coding. You relied on the AI to produce something that looked right without knowing how it actually worked.\nHowever, if you read, wrote, or edited the code while building the app, you were doing AI-assisted coding — working with the AI to shape logic, fix bugs, and design structure.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAspect\nVibe Coding\nAI-Assisted Coding\n\n\n\n\nDefinition\nA no-code workflow where you don’t read, write, or edit code. You simply test the prototype or app to see if it meets your design or intent.\nA coding workflow where you interact with and modify code using AI tools like Copilot’s Ask, Edit, or Inline Chat.\n\n\nGoal\nValidate the “vibe” — check if the prototype looks, feels, and behaves as intended.\nBuild, refine, and ship production-ready features with AI support.\n\n\nUser Interaction\nNo direct code manipulation — focus is on results, not implementation.\nActively generate, read, edit, debug, and review code and suggestions with AI\n\n\nAI Tools\nGitHub Copilot Agent Mode\nGitHub Copilot Ask Mode, Edit Mode, Inline Chat\n\n\nMindset\n“I don’t care how it’s built — does it look and work as intended?”\n“I’ll collaborate with AI to understand, fix, or enhance the code.”\n\n\nBest For\nRapid prototyping, early design validation\nFull-cycle software or data product development: feature implementation, optimization, and maintenance.\n\n\nLimitations.\nIgnores the complexity, lacks of consideration over performance, scalability, and maintainability.\nSupports real data engineering work but still requires developer understanding and validation\n\n\n\n\nI was vibe-coding\nI was doing AI-assisted coding\n\nBoth Vibe-coding and AI-assisted coding have their place in development. Use vibe-coding for quick validation and prototyping, and AI-assisted coding for building robust, production-ready data science solutions.\nAlthough vibe-coding feels exciting, you can’t rely on it from prototype to production, as it often makes mistakes or produces “shit code” — duplicated logic, buggy and insecure implementations, and tangled features no one dares to maintain. In data science, that might look like a notebook full of hard-coded file paths, random seeds, and global variables — impossible to reproduce or scale.\n\nAlso, don’t fool yourself into thinking you’re learning to code while working in Agent Mode — you’re NOT building the skills yourself. You can’t learn guitar just by watching someone else play, and you can’t learn piano by watching performances. Likewise, you can’t truly learn programming just by watching an Agent write code for you. The craft lies in understanding, experimenting, and making mistakes. That’s how you move from vibe-coding prototypes to engineered, production-ready solutions.\n\n\n4.4.2 Why the Basics Still Matters?\n\nWhy isn’t vibe coding enough for real-world data science projects?\n\nWhile vibe coding can accelerate prototyping and help non-technical users validate design ideas, it often overlooks many critical aspects of data engineering — such as scalability, performance, maintainability, and security. Building reliable data science solution or product remains a complex, multi-layered process that requires thoughtful coding, testing, and collaboration between designers, developers, and AI tools.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportantBest tip for using AI:\n\n\n\nStay focused on what really matters — let AI speed up the work, but make sure you’re the one driving the direction, decisions, and understanding.",

    "text": "5.2 Lab: Enhance Your App with LLM-Powered Interpretation\nIn this lab, you will continue building your financial dashboard by integrating AI features with Google Gemini API.\n\n5.2.1 Get Started with Gemini API\nPlease sign in to Google AI Studio using your Google account https://ai.google.dev/aistudio.\n\n\n5.2.2 Create your Google Gemini API Key\nGoogle has a free tier for the Gemini API that provides limited usage for development and experimentation.\nYou can obtain a free API key using your Google account:\n\nhttps://aistudio.google.com/api-keys\n\n\nPlease delete your key if not in use. Keep it secure, and never share or publish your key.\n\n\n5.2.3 Run A Simple Gemini Use Case\nCheck out the page &lt;https://aistudio.google.com/app/&gt; for a simple use case of how to use Gemini API. You can easily create a Colab notebook and test the sample code there — since both Gemini and Colab are Google products, they integrate seamlessly for quick experimentation.\nYou only need to modidy the following line with your api_key to run the sample code.\nclient = genai.Client(api_key=\"your_actual_api_key_here\")\n\nI successfully tested the Gemini Use Case.\n\n\n\n5.2.4 Prompt engineering\nA prompt is the input text or query given to a generative AI model to instruct it on what to do.\n\ne.g., “Write a Python function to calculate the average of a list.”\n\nIn simple terms, prompt engineering is about communicating effectively with AI. It’s the skill of writing prompts so the large language models (LLMs) understands your intent, context, and background, and can respond accurately and usefully.\nIn other words:\n\nPrompt engineering = communication skills with LLMs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nYou can explore prompt ideas for the Gemini API in Google AI studio. https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/prompts\n\n\n\n\n5.2.5 Bad vs Good Prompts\nHere is a number of examples showing how vague prompts differs from well-engineered ones. AI can understand and act only as well as you communicate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTask\nBad Prompt\nGood Prompt\nWhy It’s Better\n\n\n\n\nAsk for code\n“Write some Python code for data.”\n“Write a Python function using pandas to read a CSV file, clean missing values, and calculate the average of each column.”\nGives clear context, specific goal, and tools to use.\n\n\nExplain concept\n“Explain machine learning.”\n“Explain what machine learning is for a high school student using everyday examples.”\nSpecifies audience and tone, making the response more focused.\n\n\nGenerate text\n“Write about climate change.”\n“Write a 3-paragraph summary of climate change causes and impacts, suitable for a classroom presentation.”\nDefines length, scope, and audience.\n\n\nData science task\n“Analyze this dataset.”\n“Analyze this dataset to find the top 5 products by sales, and visualize the trend over time using matplotlib.”\nSpecifies the goal, method, and output format.\n\n\n\nFunction to Get AI Interpretation of the Z-Score\n\n\n5.2.6 Task: Design a Value-Adding AI Prompt for Your Dashboard\nYour financial metrics dashboard already allows users to select tickers and view several metrics. Now, your goal is to design a prompt that integrates a LLM from Gemini to provide AI-generated insights that add value for the users of the dashboard.\n\nDesign your prompt with clear intent and context.\n\nThe prompt should generate something useful for the dashboard user.\nIntegrate your prompt into your streamlit app. You can build on the simple use case you successfully tested earlier and try integrating it into your streamlit app using Copilot.\nTest your prompt in the dashboard to ensure it gives clear, relevant, and user-friendly outputs.\nDocument why your prompt adds value and how it helps users make better sense of the data.",
